Operations
==========

A geoprocessing model in GeoTrellis is composed of smaller geoprocessing operations with well-defined inputs and outputs. The next section describes how to create your own operations, but it is usually better to compose an operation out of existing operations if that is possible.

Operations are like a lot like a `Future[T]`__.
