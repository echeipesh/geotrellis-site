Local Operations
================

Local operations process each raster cell individually, without considering other cells’ values. When combining multiple rasters, a local operation will map the value for each input’s ``(col, row)`` cell to a single value in the output raster’s ``(col, row)`` cell. These properties allow GeoTrellis to parallelize local operations over tiles easily.

Below is each local operation with a brief explination of it's use. Fore more information, see the Scala docs for the individual operation.

Mapping and Combining
---------------------

These local operations take functions as parameters and allows the user to specify any sort of local transformation of cells:

localMap
  Transforms each integer cell value to another value by a function.

localMapDouble
  Transforms each double cell value to another value by a function.

localMapIfSet
  Transforms each integer cell value to another value by a function, if the value is not NoData.

localMapIfSetDouble
  Transforms each double cell value to another value by a function, if the value is not NoData.

localDualMap
  Map the values of a each cell to a new value; if the type of the raster is a double type, map using the double function, otherwise map using the integer function.

localCombine
  Combines the integer cell values of two or more rasters.

localCombineDouble
  Combines the double cell values of two or more rasters.
