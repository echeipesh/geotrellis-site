Gitter and Mailing List
-----------------------

We're always interested in what you're working on, if we can help, and any feedback you might have.  The primary way to interact with the project maintainers and contributors is through the `GeoTrellis Gitter`__ chat.  Additional, more formal dialogue and announcements are made via the The `geotrellis mailing list`__.  If you'd like to contact us directly, send an email to Rob Emanuele at lossyrob (at) gmail (dot) com.
