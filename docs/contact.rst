Commercial Support
------------------

Azavea_, the creators of GeoTrellis, supports future development of the platform by providing a variety of services, including the following:

Application Design and Development
  As the core GeoTrellis developers, we understand how to leverage GeoTrellis to create high quality, visually appealing applications.

Core Development
  If GeoTrellis does not include a feature that you desire, you can either extend the project yourself or fund development of that feature to ensure it is added on a particular schedule or before a particular release.  We will combine your support with that of others until there is enough backing to complete the feature.

Consulting Services
  Our software developers will work with your team to assist with performance tuning, architecture design or training on how to develop new GeoTrellis extensions.

`Contact Azavea`__ for more information.
